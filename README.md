Huffman Compression Method for Embedded Systems.
Ongoing project.

## Huffman Compression
Since it’s creation by David A. Huffman in 1952, Huffman coding has been regarded as one of the most efficient and optimal methods of compression. Huffman’s optimal compression ratios are made possible through it’s character counting functionality. Unlike many algorithms in the Lempel-Ziv suite, Huffman encoders scan the file and generate a frequency table and tree before begining the true compression process. Before discussing different implementations, lets dive deeper into how the algorithm works.

## Proposal
This library aims to make possible the usage of Huffmans Compression Method for Embedded Systems.
In this library are suposed to be present four different methods

1. compress_string: method applied to a known dataset to compress it and have back the dictionary with the values for each character by its ASCII decimal value;
2. compress_file: given a known dataset, compress it with Huffmans Compression Method and save the file for external usage;
3. decompress_string: Decompress a string compressed using this method;
4. decompress_file: Decompress a file that has receveied the comppressed content generated by this code.
