# Huffman Compression and Decompression

This project implements Huffman encoding for file compression and decompression. The algorithm minimizes the size of files by using variable-length codes based on the frequency of characters in the input file. This implementation is split into two main parts: a header file (`huffman_compression.h`) containing function declarations and the structure of the Huffman tree, and a corresponding implementation file (`huffman_compression.cpp`) containing the logic for compression and decompression.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- **`huffman_compression.h`**: Contains all necessary imports, function prototypes, and the `Node` class representing the Huffman tree.
- **`huffman_compression.cpp`**: Implements all the functions for compressing and decompressing files using Huffman encoding.

### File Descriptions:

- **`huffman_compression.h`**: 
  - Declares the structure of a Huffman Tree Node and the comparator for the priority queue.
  - Contains function prototypes for:
    - Building a frequency table from the input.
    - Constructing the Huffman tree from the frequency table.
    - Encoding a file using Huffman encoding.
    - Decompressing a Huffman-encoded file.
  
- **`huffman_compression.cpp`**:
  - Implements the functions declared in `huffman_compression.h`.
  - Handles file input/output for both compression and decompression.

## Huffman Encoding Overview

Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm. It assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequencies in the input data. More frequent characters are assigned shorter codes, while less frequent characters are given longer codes. This results in more efficient file compression.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Build Frequency Table**: 
   - The frequency of each character in the file is counted.
   
2. **Build Huffman Tree**: 
   - The characters with the lowest frequencies are merged iteratively to build a binary tree. 
   - The characters closer to the root are assigned shorter codes.
   
3. **Generate Huffman Codes**: 
   - The binary codes for each character are generated by traversing the tree.
   
4. **Compression**: 
   - The input file is converted into a binary representation using the Huffman codes and stored in a compressed format.
   
5. **Decompression**: 
   - The compressed file is decoded using the stored Huffman tree to retrieve the original data.

## Features

- **Efficient Compression**: Compresses files based on character frequency, using shorter codes for more frequent characters.
- **Decompression**: Supports decompressing Huffman-encoded files back to their original form.
- **File Input/Output**: The program can handle input files for compression and decompression directly, storing the output in separate files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/huffman-compression.git
    cd huffman-compression
    ```

2. Compile the code:
    Use a C++ compiler such as `g++` or `clang` to compile the program. You need to link both the header and implementation files.
    ```bash
    g++ -o huffman_compressor huffman_compression.cpp
    ```

## Usage

### Compression

To compress a file, provide the input file and specify the output file for storing the compressed data.

```bash
./huffman_compressor compress input.txt compressed.huff
